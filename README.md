# Wireshark Python Network Traffic Visualization

## Project Overview

The Wireshark-Python-Network-Traffic-Visualization project offers a unique approach to analyzing network traffic by providing users with an immersive visual representation of their network activities using Google Earth. This visualization is facilitated by a Python script that extracts data from Wireshark, a widely used network protocol analyzer, and integrates it into the program to generate the final visualization.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **Python**
- **Wireshark**
- **Google Earth**
- **Geolitecity Database**

## Program Walk-through

The program guides users through the process of visualizing network traffic data on Google Earth. Here's a brief walk-through of the steps involved:

1. **Data Extraction**:
